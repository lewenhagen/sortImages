SortImages
-----------

Sorts a collection of images into folders. Presumed copies ends up in separate folder, as well as images without date information.  

The images sorts into year and month they are taken.

How-to
----------
Paste your image collection (ignores folder structure) into the folder called `images` in the root directory. Open index.php in browser and click on "go". Wait...wait...wait...done. The images are sorted.
